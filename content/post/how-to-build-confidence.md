I recently had a conversation with my Uncle regarding confidence in life.

Since I'm from an Indian heritage and background, my parents and my uncles weren't well off when they were growing up.
They didn't have the fallback / cushion of a well-off family to support them in their endeavors.

They had to work hard, and they had to work smart. Recently I've been trying to imbibe and incorporate Atomic Habits into my routine.

The basics, such as waking up at a consistent time of day, eating at fixed intervals etc. etc.

However, I always seem to fail at building these habits. We were talking about why that is the case: Why do I fail at building habits and doing things that I know I want to do, yet I still somehow manage to fail at doing them all the time?

The response that I got was eye-opening. It's because I know that I'll most probably fall. Sure, I might fall to the extent where I don't get what I want out of life; however, I will never fall far enough to be homeless or to be on the streets (i hope!), far enough to be in a position where I can't afford to eat, or far enough to be in a position where I can't afford to pay rent.

I'll never fall far enough to break my back and be unable to get back up. That's because I have a family that will support me. I have a family that will help me get back up. I have a family that will help me get back on my feet. I have a cushion.

And that's why I fail at building habits. That's why I fail at building confidence. That's why I fail at building a life that I want to live. Because I know that I'll never fall far enough to be in a position where I can't get back up.

Now, my parents and my uncles’ generation didn't have this cushion. It was do or die. And thus they did.

This circles back to another one of my my life's biggest philosophies and drivers of action i.e. '`hunger`'.

People who are hungry, people who want something with all their heart, get it. This is summarised in the popular quote:

> Where there is a will, there is a way

Also, another idea that I've had is ones *value system* and how it affects their confidence and their ability to get what they want out of life.

Say you are an undergraduate and you use your dad's / mom’s contacts to get internships, jobs and titles in life, you will never go far.
While you might gain short-term success, I do not think that individuals who use their dad's contacts to get ahead in life will ever be truly happy or satisfied with their lives.

A brilliant parenting tactic is to make your child hungry. Make them want something so bad that they can't sleep at night. Make them want something so bad that they can't think of anything else. 

Another way to build overall confidence is to make it very clear that after their bachelor's degree, you will not support them financially. They will not get money in their bank account once every month. They have to work, find a job and make ends meet. Of course, if something goes terribly wrong, they will always have you to fall back on, but you as a parent should make it very clear that you will not support them financially after their bachelor's degree, and the 'fallback' is the last resort to be exercised only in times of intense need and suffering. All the other times, when your child thinks it's the 'end of the world' or 'they can't stay afloat', they have to figure it out themselves.

This will give your child confidence that they can survive on their own. This will force them to build skills in all areas of life not just academics. This will force them to grow up and will also allow them to use skills they have learned in one domain of life in others allowing them to think laterally and be an all-around human being, instead of a one-dimensional human being who's completely dependent on their parents for everything.

Sorry for the terrible grammar and structure of this post. I just wanted to get my thoughts out there. I'll come back and edit this post later.

Thanks
