## Idea 01: How Social Media is a Casino

### **The scarcity loop**

- Casinos were a relatively small industry earlier.
- An entrepreneur named Si Redd revolutionized slot design
- Addictive loop
    - Opportunity
        - The person has to feel as if there is a chance to win something. Statistically, impossible, however the brain must *feel* like it has a fighting chance.
    - Unpredictability
        - The reward or “win” has to be given un-predictably. This keeps the player engaged.
    - Repeatability
        - Should be painless, frictionless and quick to repeat.

`Earlier` slot machines had mechanical bars to turn the slots and there were only 3 slots…
This led to the following:

- lack of Opportunity felt by the players (odds are low that all 3 symbols match). **(BAD)**
- not much Un-predictability as most of the times the user lost. **(BAD)**
- Hard, painful and conscious repetition. **(BAD)**

`Now:` 

- Lots of opportunity as the number of scrolling bars have increased.
- High unpredictability as if any out of the 5 match, a small reward is given


    > Invest $1, win $0.50 but feel like you’ve won $2

- VERY very easy to repeat (digital screens), just press a button and the colourful screen will spin another one!


> 💡 Current social media platforms do the same thing.


> 💡 Your Google Feed, YouTube feed, [chess.com](http://chess.com) feed all employ the above 3 psychological hacks to keep you scrolling, and increase their revenue.


## Idea 02: Less is More

- A Ivy league educated engineer was building a lego bridge with his son.
- The son removed a brick and this made the bridge more stable.
- Taught the engineer a lesson, less is more. He, with all of his education never thought that removing a brick could lead to a safer and more stable bridge.

- Multiple experiments have been conducted, people just cannot think that removing something leads to a better result as it’s counterintuitive in the brain-washed population of the 21st century.
- We always think: MORE, MORE, MORE…. ADD, ADD, ADD
    - Bigger House!
    - Better Car!
    - An extra 2 Mil in the Bank wouldn’t hurt
    - CEO isn’t enough, I need to chair the Board!


## Idea 03: How we become obese

- McDonalds is addictive.
Don’t become obese.

That’s all I had time for today!
