## Idea 01: How Social Media Is a Casino

### The scarcity loop

Casinos constituted a modest industry earlier.

- An entrepreneur named Si Redd revolutionized slot design.

- *Addictive loop*
    - Opportunity
        - The person must feel as if there is a chance to win something. Statistically, it is impossible; yet the brain must feel like it has a fighting chance.
    - Unpredictability
        - The reward or “win” must be given unpredictably. This keeps the player engaged.
    - Repeatability
        - Should be painless, frictionless, and quick to repeat.

`Earlier` slot machines had mechanical bars to turn the slots and there were only 3 slots…

This led to the following:

- Lack of opportunity felt by the players (odds are low that all 3 symbols match). (BAD)

Not much unpredictability as most of the time the user lost. (BAD)

- Hard, painful, and conscious repetition. (BAD)

`Now:`

- Lots of opportunity as the number of scrolling bars have increased.
- High unpredictability, as if any out of the 5 matches, a small reward is given.
    - Invest $1, win $0.50 but feel like you’ve won $2.
- EXTREMELY easy to repeat (digital screens). Just press a button. The colorful screen will show a new one!

## Idea 02: Less is More

- An Ivy league educated engineer was building a Lego bridge with his son.
- The son removed a brick and this made the bridge more stable.
- Taught the engineer a lesson, less is more. He, with all of his education never thought that removing a brick could lead to a safer and more stable bridge.
- Multiple experiments have been conducted, people just cannot think that removing something leads to a better result as it’s counterintuitive in the brain-washed population of the 21st century.
- We always think: MORE, MORE, MORE…. ADD, ADD, ADD
    - Bigger House!
    - Better car!
    - An extra 2 mil in the bank wouldn’t hurt.
    - CEO isn’t enough; I need to chair the Board!

## Idea 03: How we become obese

McDonald's is addictive.

Don’t become obese.
